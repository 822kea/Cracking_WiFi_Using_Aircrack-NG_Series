# Cracking WiFi Using Aircrack-NG Lab Series

Welcome to the Cracking Wi-Fi Using Aircrack-NG Lab Series! 

This repository contains a step-by-step guide for cyber enthusiasts looking to learn how to analyze Wi-Fi networks, capture packets, and understand how security flaws can be exploited. 

### These techniques are intended solely for educational purposes to help you secure your own networks and understand wireless vulnerabilities. ###

I have to give credit to `Zaid Sabih`! 

I learned all this cool stuff by watching his course on Udemy. I highly recommend it!
