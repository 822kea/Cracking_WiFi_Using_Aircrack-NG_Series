Cracking Wi-Fi Using Aircrack-NG Series

Welcome to the Cracking Wi-Fi Using Aircrack-NG series! This repository contains a step-by-step guide for ethical hacking enthusiasts looking to learn how to analyze Wi-Fi networks, capture packets, and understand how security flaws can be exploited. These techniques are intended solely for educational purposes to help you secure your own networks and understand wireless vulnerabilities.

I have to give credit to Zaid Sabih! I learned all this cool stuff by watching his course on Udemy. I highly recommend it! https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/
